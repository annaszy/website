Self-Driving Car Competition
============================

.. note:: Registration opens on **Monday, August 26**.

The goal of this competition is to engage students in hardware-software development of a self-driving car for racing. Teams of 2 to 4 students compete to build the fastest car and have one semester to prepare for the two races, when all cars, turn by turn, race to record the fastest time. The competition is directed to junior and senior USC Viterbi undergraduate studends, and USC Viterbi master students regardless of their program or year. Sophomore undergraduate students are also welcome; however, the difficulty of this competition may be more appropriate for more experienced students. Students are not expected to have prior experience with self-driving cars. Teams will receive instructions how to assemble a car from scratch, solder a Raspberry Pi HAT and program the control algorithm of a self-driving car. All cars are built on the same platform and race against each other on the same track configuration, thus innovation and creativity is what counts.

To help the teams get started and provide support along the way, a series of workshops on embedded hardware and software concepts will be organized, along with optional weekly sessions where teams can work on their projects and interact with other teams. Though these workshops are meant to help the teams develop their car, outside work on the project will be necessary, since an exceptional car will require thoughtful optimization to excel. With these workshops as a starting place, teams are given the unique opportunity to apply their technical knowledge and creative abilities to a real-world situation.



Registration
------------

Upon registration, teams will receive all required components for assembling a self-driving car. Each team (not each individual member) will pay $100 as registration fee and $60 for deposit to offset the cost of the car. The original cost of the car including all electronic components required for the competition is approximately $250. At the end, teams which participated in both races will receive their deposit back irespective of their performance in the competition.

The car is built around a 1/10 scale RC touring chassis powered by a brushed motor and a 2â€“cell LiPo battery. The Raspberry Pi microprocessor through image processing will detect the track from the images supplied by a camera and adjust the steering angle and the motor speed to keep the car on the track. The images below show the assembled car, the camera and the Raspberry Pi board that when assemble form the car to be raced. The chassis, battery and the motor are regulated to ensure that no team gains an advantage through better components, and that creativity and superior programming differentiate the teams.

Modifications of the chassis are allowed as long as they follow the :ref:Rules. Moreover, more sensors can be added as long as the camera remains the main sensor used for steering the car. Cars are permitted to have a wireless connection with a computer for development and calibration, however, during the final race the car should operate autonomously and no external connection is permitted. All cars will be inspected before the final race and only the ones which comply with the above rules will be allowed to compete.
